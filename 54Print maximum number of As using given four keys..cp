 Let us assume that we have a special keyboard with only the following four keys:
 Key 1:  Prints 'A' on screen
 Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Selects screen
 Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer
 Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Prints buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.
 If you can only press this keyboard for N times, write a program which computes maximum numbers of As possible. That is input for the program is N and output of the program is number indicating maximum As possible.

/*
 
 If number of allowed keystrokes(N) is less than 7, then the maximum number of As possible is N itself. You should be able to verify this yourself.
 
 It turns out that for N greater than or equal to 7, to produce maximum number of As, the sequence of N keystrokes that will be used will always end with a suffix of Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, followed by all Ctrl-V's. The main task then is to find out the critical-point after which we should put above suffix of keystrokes to get maximum number of As.
