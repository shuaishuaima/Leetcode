 Given an array, find the maximum possible value of sum of index-element-products(i*array[i]) with only rotations allowed on a given array. Sum of index-element-products for array of length 'n' is computed as - 0*array[0] + 1*array[1] + 2*array[2] + ... + n-1*array[n-1].
 
 For example, for the array {3,4,5,6,1,2} without doing any rotations sum of index-element-products is 46. After doing one clockwise rotation of the array, it would be modified to {2,3,4,5,6,1} and sum of index-element-products in this case is 55.
 As you should be able to confirm, maximum value of sum of index-element-products for this given array is 70 which is obtained after performing two clockwise rotations in which case modified array is {1,2,3,4,5,6}.
 
 For the array {24,26,25,22},
 index-element-products sum without any rotation is 142. The maximum sum of index-element-products that could be obtained is 151 which is obtained with one clockwise rotation(modified array {22,24,26,25}).
