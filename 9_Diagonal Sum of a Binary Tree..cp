 Consider lines drawn at an angle of 135 degrees(that is slope = -1) which cut through the left branches of a given binary tree. A diagonal is formed by nodes which lie between two such consecutive lines. If we are able to draw 'n' lines then the complete tree is divided into 'n+1' diagonals. Diagonal sum in a binary tree is sum of all node's values lying between these lines. Given a binary tree, print all diagonal sums. Please note that all right branches are drawn parallel to each other and all left branches are also drawn parallel to each other.
