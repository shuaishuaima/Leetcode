/*
 
 
 Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
 
 Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
 
 All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.
 
 For example,
 Given "egg", "add", return true.
 
 Given "foo", "bar", return false.
 
 Given "paper", "title", return true.
 
 Note:
 You may assume both s and t have the same length.

//can't use one vector, wrong answer like "ab","ca".
