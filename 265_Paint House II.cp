 There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 
 The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs0 is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs1 is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 
 Note: All costs are positive integers.
 
 Follow up: Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?
